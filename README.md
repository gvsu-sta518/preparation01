Preparation 1 - Git-ing Started
================

All of your work for STA 418/518 will be completed using GitHub. This
activity will walk you through practicing some of the GitHub steps to
get more comfortable with this workflow.

Remember that you watched a video from Daniel Shiffman to prepare you
for our first class meeting. For completeness, this video is provided
here if you would like to rewatch it (13:43 minutes).

GitHub](http://img.youtube.com/vi/BCQHnlnPusY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCQHnlnPusY "1.1 Introduction - Git and GitHub for Poets")

### Estimated Time

-   üéû Three Videos: 45 minutes
-   ‚òëÔ∏è Four Tasks: 20-30 minutes

## More Git and GitHub

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 1: Introduction

First, you will need to create your own new repo (not forking my repo
like we did during class). You can follow [GitHub‚Äôs recommneded
steps](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/create-a-repo#create-a-repository)
(stopping once you reach the ‚ÄúCommit your first change‚Äù section). In
step 2, name your repository `preparation01`. In step 4, you can choose
to make your repository private if you would prefer - you will be doing
some reflective writing. If you choose to make your repo private, you
will need to grant me (`@dykesb`) [access to your private
repository](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13683056).

In your new repository, *create a new markdown file* called
`kohn-reflection.md`. In the video you watched for our first class
session (that is also provided above), Daniel created a raw text file
(`.txt`). However, here I am asking you to instead create a markdown
file (`.md`). In this newly created markdown file, write a reflection
(around a full page, approximately 500 words, with multiple paragraphs)
after reading Alfie‚Äôs article. This should be a reflection, not simply
reporting what Alfie‚Äôs article says. Some prompts that you may find
useful are provided below, but feel free to make this reflection your
own!

1.  Describe a class where you felt your final grade in a course did not
    match with what you learned throughout the semester (this could be
    where your grade was ‚Äútoo low‚Äù or ‚Äútoo high‚Äù).
2.  What do you think grades represent? What is your experience with
    grades?
3.  If grades were removed from courses, what would you use for
    motivation? What value would learning have for you without grades?
4.  Describe a time where you took the ‚Äúeasy way out‚Äù for an assignment.
    Why did you choose to go this route?

This repository also contains a `README.md` file. Edit this by providing
a brief description of what your `preparation01` repo contains to help
future you remember.

#### Changes in GitHub

In the video, you may have noticed that Daniel keeps referring to the
‚Äú`master` branch.‚Äù While Git‚Äôs ‚Äú`master`‚Äù branch naming convention was
likely from the [‚Äúmaster
copy‚Äù](https://mail.gnome.org/archives/desktop-devel-list/2019-May/msg00066.html)
or ‚Äúmaster recording‚Äù use of the word, there also a history of
[‚Äúmaster/slave‚Äù](https://twitter.com/jpaulreed/status/1272038656799211521)
that has been used in many technology applications. The language that we
use matters. The term ‚Äúmaster‚Äù has an oppressive association, and there
are better, more inclusive words that we can use. [Beginning October
2020](https://github.com/github/renaming), GitHub began using ‚Äú`main`‚Äù
instead of ‚Äú`master`‚Äù for all newly-created repositories. I have gotten
better at referring to it as the ‚Äú`main`‚Äù branch, but I might slip-up.

I am aware that renaming GitHub branches is not going to magically solve
the larger issue of structural racism/discrimination in the world. I
encourage you to think of ways that you can work to dismantle racism.
One idea would be to become involved in organizations that support
racial justice. Some amazing organizations/communities are [Data For
Black Lives](https://d4bl.org/), [MiR
Community](https://twitter.com/MiR_community), and
[RLadies](https://rladies.org/).

## Branches and Pull Requests

These next two videos are meant to provide you with insight into/an
awareness of what else you can do in GitHub. I expect these steps will
be new, different, and confusing to most of you. That is OK! We will get
continue to practice these steps throughout the semester. A good place
to start in watching these videos to indentify the new terms and relate
them to another process that you are more familar with (e.g., Google
Drive).

### üéû Video 1: Branches (11:54 minutes)

[![Branches](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oPpnCh7InLY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oPpnCh7InLY "1.2 Branches - Git and GitHub for Poets")

**Be aware** that the network plot Daniel shows during this video is now
located at üíπ Insights \> Network (on the left-hand toolbar).

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Create a new branch in a GitHub repository,
-   Switch between branches in GitHub,
-   Edit and commit changes to a separate branches in GitHub, and
-   Merge branches with a pull request.

### ‚òëÔ∏è Task 2: Make a branch and pull request

Create a new branch of your `preparation01` repository. Name this branch
after your favorite color (or simply the first color you think of).

In this new branch, **add** to your `README.md` by finding a link to a
[gif](https://giphy.com/) that speaks to your current feeling(s) and
include this as an image ([Remember how to do this in
markdown?](https://commonmark.org/help/)).

Create a **Pull Request** to your `main` branch from your new branch.

You are done working in your `preparation01` repository. The next two
videos are to demonstrate some typically used processes in GitHub when
collaborating with others. For the beginning portion of this semester,
we will focus on doing work alone in GitHub (or collaborating with
ourselves - i.e., using GitHub as an online code storage system).
However, you may want to collaborate with a peer on your project so we
will start to sprinkle these ideas in later.

## Forks and Pull Requests

### üéû Video 2: Forks and Pull Request (12:22 minutes)

[![Forks and Pull
Requests](http://img.youtube.com/vi/oPpnCh7InLY/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_NrSWLQsDL4 "1.3 Forks and Pull Requests - Git and GitHub for Poets")

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Describe what forking is in Git/GitHub.
-   Describe what a pull request is.

## Issues

### üéû Video 3: Issues and Markdown (11:31 minutes)

[![Issues](http://img.youtube.com/vi/WMykv2ZMyEQ/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WMykv2ZMyEQ "1.4 Issues - Git and GitHub for Poets")

At the end of this video, learners will be able to:

-   Describe what an Issue is in GitHub.
-   Respond to an Issue in GitHub.

## ‚òëÔ∏è Tasks 3: Respond to a different kind of issue

In our Teams workspace, find the `SS2022 STA 418-518 S01` channel. In
this channel, there should be a post called ‚ÄúDay 2 Muddiness‚Äù that I
created.

This post currently includes my planned agenda for our second class
session. From the syllabus you saw that I want to encourage you seek
help in visible ways and the Teams workspace is one way to do this!

In this post, provide details for what was the muddiest thing from this
Preparation. If someone else already mentioned what you thought was
muddy, give them a ‚Äú+ 1‚Äù üëç.

You will continue to do this for each Preparation. This is one way to
ask me to discuss things at the beginning of a class session (and with
enough heads up, I can provide a better discussion). If, as your working
on non-Preparation material, you experience some ‚Äúmuddiness‚Äù, create a
post in the class channel or create a new themed channel. You can always
ask questions live during our class sessions.

### Optional

-   Personalize your GitHub profile with a picture, name, etc. We will
    find a *hidden* GitHub feature next week for how we can make our
    GitHub profiles more informative.
-   Register for the (free!) [Student Developer
    Pack](https://education.github.com/pack) with GitHub
